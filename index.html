        I've been hearing about React since I started learning JavaScript, but I must admit that I took a look at it
        and it scared me. I saw what resembled a lot of HTML blended in with JavaScript.
        After a couple of baffled endeavors to begin with React, I at long last began to get it, and I started to
        perceive any reason why I should utilize react rather than vanilla js or jquery.
        If you are new to react js or you want just refreshing yourself on the basic concepts, this React Js overview
        will allow you to go over some of the top features of the react library so that you can understand react
        better before moving on to something more advanced.

      </p>

      <h2>WHY REACT JS?</h2>
      <p>
        React JS is essentially a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, built and launched in 2013 by
        Facebook. The React Js overview by Jordan Walke, the creator of React JS, emphasizes that React is an
        efficient, revealing, and adaptable open-source JavaScript library for creating simple, fast, and versatile
        web application interfaces.
        React JS can undoubtedly be considered a success. Today it is used by the largest companies, such as Apple,
        PayPal, Netflix, while more than 220,000 live websites are built using the React JS framework.
        Given that countless organizations use React JS, including some of the world's leading brands, React must
        offer unprecedented benefits, right?
        Yes, exactly it doesâ€¦
        Have you asked yourself? Why or what are the main benefits of React JS that have encouraged so many popular
        companies and brands to use it?

      </p>
      <h2>IT PROVIDES YOU A UNIQUE ABSTRACTION LAYER</h2>
      <p>Another less known advantage of React is that it provides a good abstraction layer, which means that an
        end-user cannot access complex internal elements. Your developer only needs to know a few basic principles,
        and it is better if he knows the internal features. Also, he does not dictate architectural models such as
        MVC, MVP, and MVVM. Your developer is free to design the architecture of an application as he or she sees fit.
      </p>
      <h2>EASIER TO LEARN</h2>
      <p>One of the main concerns of developers is to choose a framework (or library) that is easier to learn and
        implement. React is easy to learn for developers who are familiar with Javascript. So if you have a team of
        developers who are familiar with Javascript and have a general React Js overview, we guarantee you with all
        reliability that React JS should be your best choice.
        However, even if developers are not familiar with Javascript, React may be the right place to start. Unlike
        Angular, React has a steady learning curve.
        In fact, this is one of the main reasons why React Js overview a popularity in
        a short period of time. It helps companies build their projects quickly.
        You see, the harder it is to learn a particular technology or framework, the longer it will take to start the
        development process. And we, as human beings, often tend to avoid things that are difficult to learn.

      </p>
      <h2>IT ALLOWS CREATING RICH USER INTERFACES</h2>
      <p>Today, the quality of the user interface in an application plays an important role. If the user interface is
        poorly designed, it reduces an application's chances of success.
        But, if an application has a high-quality user interface, there is a better chance that your users will enjoy
        using the application.
        Therefore, creating rich user interfaces is somehow necessary for an application to survive and thrive.
        A great React Js overview news underlines that React allows
        creating rich and high-quality user interfaces thanks to its declarative components, which brings us to our
        next point.

      </p>
      <h2>DYNAMIC ECOSYSTEM OF DEVELOPMENT TOOLS </h2>
      <p>React is a rich and dynamic ecosystem. Developers can find a React Js overview about dozens of ready-to-use
        and customizable graphics, diagrams, documentation tools, and other components that allow them to create a web
        application in less time without having to reinvent the wheel. There's this impressive collection of React JS
        development tools and tutorials that help developers build impressive things.
      </p>
      <h2>REACT ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO REUSE </h2>
      <p>In React, your application is composed of components. Ideally, you start by building small components such as
        buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, menus, etc. and you create wrapping components around these small
        components.
        And as you write the higher-level wrapper components, you will have a single root component and several
        hierarchical components.
        Here is a simple React Js overview for an application example: each component in React has its own logic. So
        if you want to reuse the button component through your application, you can go ahead. I'm pretty sure everyone
        wants to be able to reuse the component in their project.

      </p>
      <h2>INCREASES DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY </h2>
      <p>Frequent updates often become a headache when an application has complex logic and when a single change in
        one component can significantly affect other components.
        But to combat this problem, Facebook has amplified React with the component reuse feature.
        Component reusability in React essentially allows developers to redeploy the same digital objects.
        ReactJs overview the process as too simple! Developers, for example, can start adding simple components such
        as buttons, text fields, and checkboxes, and then move them to the wrapper components, which are finally moved
        to the root component.
        This approach essentially offers better code maintenance and better growth, because each component of React
        has its own internal logic, which is easy to manipulate and therefore increases the productivity of
        application development.

      </p>
      <h2>IT IS SEO-FRIENDLY </h2>
      <p>For any online business, search engine optimization is the gateway to success. According to Moz, the lower
        the page load time and the faster the rendering speed, the higher the Google ranking of an application.
        Thanks to its fast rendering, React Js overview the fastest loading time,
        compared to other frameworks, and significantly reduces page loading time, which greatly helps companies to
        achieve top rankings on the Google search engine results page.

      </p>
      <h2>IT OFFERS FAST RENDERING</h2>
      <p>When you create a complex and high load application, it becomes mandatory to define the application structure
        at the beginning, as it can impact the performance of your application.
        In simple terms, the DOM model is structured in a tree structure. Thus, a minor change to a higher level layer
        can have a terrible impact on an application's user interface. To solve this problem, Facebook with React Js
        overviews a virtual DOM feature.
        The virtual DOM, as its name suggests, is the virtual representation of the DOM, which allows testing first
        all the modifications of the virtual DOM to calculate the risks at each modification. The virtual DOM, as its
        name suggests, is the virtual representation of the DOM which allows testing first all the modifications of
        the virtual DOM to calculate the risks at each modification.
        This approach, therefore, helps maintain high application performance and ensures a better user experience.

      </p>
      <h2>STRONG COMMUNITY SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>Just like Angular, React also has a very strong community support, which is one of the main reasons to adopt
        React JS in your project.
        Every day, a large number of individual React developers contribute to make React a better frontend framework.
        Currently, React Js has reached 136,079 stars on Github and 1,331 regular contributors.
        Besides, experts regularly download free React tutorials from Youtube and write articles and blogs of in-depth
        React tutorials on the Internet. For example, a simple search for "free React tutorial" on Google gives
        13,00,000 results.
        Apart from that, React experts also regularly resolve doubts on quality assurance sites such as Stack Overflow
        and Quora, which means that if you get stuck when using React, you can always get reliable solutions provided
        by experts.
      </p>
      <h2>IT OFFERS BETTER CODE STABILITY </h2>
      <p>React Js overview and monitors the top-down data flow to ensure that the parent structure is not affected by
        changes in the children's structure. Thus, when a developer makes changes to an object, he simply changes its
        states and makes the appropriate modifications. This way, only a specific item will be updated.
        As a result, this data flow and structure ensures better code stability and application performance.
      </p>

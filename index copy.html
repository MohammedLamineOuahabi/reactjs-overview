      <H1 class="title">Why react JS?</H1>


      <p><strong>React JS</strong> is essentially
        a
        JavaScript library built and launched in 2013 by Facebook. As React JS
        creator,&nbsp;<strong>Jordan Walke </strong>&nbsp; , points
        out, React is an efficient, revealing, and adaptable open-source JavaScript
        library for creating simple, fast, and versatile web application
        interfaces.&nbsp; </p>

      <p> React JS can
        undoubtedly be considered a success. Today it is used by the largest companies,
        such as Apple, PayPal, Netflix, while more than 220,000 live websites are built
        using the React JS framework. </p>

      <p>Given that countless
        organizations use React JS, including some of the world's leading brands, React
        must offer unprecedented benefits, right?&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Yes, exactly it doesâ€¦</p>

      <p>Have you asked
        yourself &nbsp;? Why or what are the main benefits of React JS
        that have encouraged so many popular companies and brands to use it?</p>


      <h2>It provides you a
        unique abstraction layer:</h2>
      <p>Another less known advantage of React is
        that it provides a good abstraction layer, which means that an end-user cannot
        access complex internal elements. Your developer only needs to know a few basic
        principles, and it is better if he knows the internal features. Also, he does
        not dictate architectural models such as MVC, MVP, and MVVM. Your developer is
        free to design the architecture of an application as he or she sees fit.</span></p>
      <h2>It's easier for
        developers to learn:</h2>
      <p>
        One of the main concerns of developers is to
        choose a framework (or library) that is easier to learn and implement. React is
        easy to learn for developers who are familiar with <span>Javascript</span>.
        So if you have a team of developers who are familiar with <span>Javascript</span>,
        React JS should be your best choice. </p>

      <p>However, even if
        developers are not familiar with <span>Javascript</span>, React
        may be the right place to start. Unlike Angular, React has a steady learning
        curve.</p>

      <p>In fact, this is one
        of the main reasons why React has gained popularity in a short period of time.
        It helps companies build their projects quickly.</p>

      <p>You see, the harder it
        is to learn a particular technology or framework, the longer it will take to
        start the development process. And we, as human beings, often tend to avoid
        things that are difficult to learn. </p>
      <h2>It allows creating
        rich user interfaces:</h2>
      <p>Today, the quality of the user interface in an
        application plays an important role. If the user interface is poorly designed,
        it reduces an application's chances of success. </p>



      <p> But, if an application
        has a high-quality user interface, there is a better chance that your users
        will enjoy using the application.</p>

      <p>
        Therefore, creating rich user interfaces is somehow
        necessary for an application to survive and thrive.The good news is that React
        allows creating rich and high-quality user interfaces thanks to its declarative
        components, which brings us to our next point.</p>
      <h2>He is well established
        with a
        dynamic ecosystem of development tools:</h2>
      <p> React
        is a rich and dynamic
        ecosystem. Developers can find dozens of ready-to-use and customizable
        graphics, diagrams, documentation tools, and other components that allow them
        to create a web application in less time without having to reinvent the wheel.
        There's this impressive collection of React JS development tools and tutorials
        that help developers build impressive things.</p>
      <h2>React allows
        developers to reuse:</h2>
      <p>
        In React, your application is composed of
        components. Ideally, you start by building small components such as buttons,
        checkboxes, drop-down lists, menus, etc. and you create wrapping components
        around these small components. </p>

      <p> And as you write the
        higher-level wrapper components, you will have a single root component and
        several hierarchical components. </p>

      <p>Here is a simple example: each component in React has
        its own logic. So if you want to reuse the button component through your
        application, you can go ahead. I'm pretty sure everyone wants to be able to
        reuse the component in their project.</p>
      <h2>Increases developer
        productivity: </h2>
      <p>Frequent updates often become a headache when an
        application has complex logic and when a single change in one component can
        significantly affect other components.</p>

      <p> But to combat this
        problem, Facebook has amplified React with the component reuse feature.</p>

      <p> Component reusability
        in React essentially allows developers to redeploy the same digital objects.</p>

      <p> The process is simple
        too! Developers, for example, can start adding simple components such as
        buttons, text fields, and checkboxes, and then move them to the wrapper
        components, which are finally moved to the root component.</p>

      <p> This approach
        essentially offers better code maintenance and better growth, because each
        component of React has its own internal logic, which is easy to manipulate and
        therefore increases the productivity of application development.</p>
      <h2>It is
        SEO-friendly: </h2>
      <p>For any online business, search engine optimization is
        the gateway to success.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>According to <span class=SpellE>Moz</span>,
        the lower the page load time and the faster the rendering speed, the higher the
        Google ranking of an application.</p>

      <p>Thanks to its fast rendering, React, compared to other
        frameworks, and significantly reduces page loading time, which greatly helps
        companies to achieve top rankings on the Google search engine results page.</p>
      <h2>It offers fast
        rendering:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>When you create a complex and high load application,
        it becomes mandatory to define the application structure at the beginning, as
        it can impact the performance of your application.In
        simple terms, the DOM model is structured in a tree structure. Thus, a minor
        change to a higher level layer can have a terrible impact on an application's
        user interface. To solve this problem, Facebook has introduced a virtual DOM
        feature. </p>

      <p> The virtual DOM, as
        its name suggests, is the virtual representation of the DOM which allows
        testing first all the modifications of the virtual DOM to calculate the risks
        at each modification. </p>

      <p>This approach, therefore, helps maintain high
        application performance and ensures a better user experience. </p>
      <h2>Strong community
        support:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p> Just like Angular, React also has a very strong community support, which
        is one of the main reasons to adopt React JS in your project. </p>

      <p> Every day, a large
        number of individual React developers contribute to make React
        a better frontend framework. Currently, React JS has reached 136,079 stars on
        Github and 1,331 regular contributors. </p>

      <p> Besides, experts
        regularly download free React tutorials from Youtube
        and write articles and blogs of in-depth React tutorials on the Internet. For
        example, a simple search for &quot;free React tutorial&quot; on Google gives 13<span class=GramE>,00,000</span>
        results.</span></p>

      <p>Apart from that,React
        experts also regularly resolve doubts on quality
        assurance sites such as Stack Overflow and Quora,
        which means that if you get stuck when using React, you can always get reliable
        solutions provided by experts.</p>








      <h2>It offers better code
        stability:</h2>
      <p> React monitors the top-down data flow to ensure that the parent
        structure is not affected by changes in the children's structure. Thus, when a
        developer makes changes to an object, he simply changes its states and makes
        the appropriate modifications. This way , only a specific
        item will be updated . </p>

      <p> As a result, this data
        flow and structure ensures better code stability and application performance. </p>

      <p><i> So </i> you're ready for the bestseller
        and latest coding fad. Everyone is talking about this new JavaScript React JS
        library and you want to be part of the React community. </p>

        pages on average! Or you are brand new and don't even know where to start your
        training in React JavaScript coding.</p>
